### Hello there 👋, my name is Egor

I am a graduate Master in astrophysics at EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). I now work as a research assistant in the AI group of Fermilab (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, US).

In the course of my research activity, I work with time series analysis. Specifically, I enhance Gaussian processes with neural networks to solve the tasks of time series interpolation and forecasting. I have previously worked on computer vision tasks: inference of non-linearly transformed Gaussian processes, development of generative neural networks, and spectral analysis of images.

My current work is:
 - 40% machine learning 🚀
 - 25% software development 👨‍💻
 - 25% statistics 🧑‍🔬
 - 10% physics 🪐

I currently look for positions in finance and IT, with the tasks that imply the use of deep learning, statistics and software development.

Skills: Deep learning, Statistics, Optimisation, Data analysis, Software engineering
Programming Languages: Python, Haskell, C++
Machine learning and Optimisation: PyTorch, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Scikit, Jax
Other: Git, Bash


Languages: English (C1), Russian (Native)
